# Ruby Tuesday
### Finally getting Ruby squared away on Mac to start Jekyll.

As a way to chronicle my homelab journey this process starts with getting Jekyll up and running. If you aren't familiar, Jekyll is a static website generator that can take simple markdown code and convert it to markup using github's ci/cd or continuous integration/continuous delivery infrastucture. Having used git's repositories during my web development class of 2020 I had a basic understanding of how they operated and I had Mac cli integration already "baked in".
